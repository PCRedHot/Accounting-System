At the beginning, John has the following accounts:
Name  balance Type

Bank	2000.00	Asset

On 27/4/2019, he withdraw $500 from the bank
On 28/4/2019, he spent $200 on food using cash

However, he later found out that he actually spent $250 on food instead of $200. So he corrected the transaction by deleting it and creating a new one
