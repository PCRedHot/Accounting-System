At the beginning, John has the following accounts:
Name	Balance	Type
Cash	200.00	Asset
Bank	2000.00	Asset

On 27/4/2019, he withdraw $500 from the bank
On 28/7/2019, he spent $200 on food using cash to pay

However, he later found out that he actually spent $250 on food instead of $200
So he corrected the transaction by deleting it and creating a new one

The file account is the initial account storage
The file input.txt includes the input to perform the above transaction
The files account.txt and transaction.txt include all accounts and transactions at the end of March (sort in ascending order)
