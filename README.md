## Usage


### Step 1. Makefile

If you are using Accounting System for the first time, it's necessary to compile the executable programs from source files by reading Makefile.

Users can type in the command below to compile run.cpp

    $ make run

If succeed, your terminal will display compilation process shown below

    g++ -c run.cpp
    g++ -c account.cpp
    g++ -c accountlib.cpp
    g++ -c transaction.cpp
    g++ -c tranlib.cpp
    g++ -c AccountingSystem.cpp
    g++ run.o account.o accountlib.o transaction.o tranlib.o AccountingSystem.o -o run

Congratulations! The program has been built successfully.

### Step 2. Run the program

The executable program now is created in your folder, named **run**.

You can type in the command below to run the program in terminal.

    $ ./run

If succeed, the program will display like this
